# tdd-practice
A Python CLI app that does stuff - and uses tdd principles

Coronavirus tracker. Uses .Gov API. Will figure out what kind of searches it will allow to be run.

The app will be written tests first. Since I am basically following [the TDD with Python guide from freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe/), the app will use unittest module.
