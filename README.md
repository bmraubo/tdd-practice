# tdd-practice
A Python CLI app that does stuff - and uses tdd principles

The app will use Ow.ly API to shorted URL links. The user will input the long url, and the app will provide the short url. The app will also keep a history (that can be cleared) of the last 10 operations.

The app will be written tests first. Since I am basically following [the TDD with Python guide from freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe/), the app will use unittest module.
